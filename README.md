This program is a failure, I will be moving the repo to my Deprecated Projects folder soon, if I don't figure out how to fix it

This was meant ot be a Genetic Algorithm based painting bot, that takes user defined strokes and generates the provided image

# To-do

- [X] Reduce the number of strokes to 6-8, and store their positions, so that mutate function can select the best strokes, instead of the current blending of the images
